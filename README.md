# TODO:
- [ ] To optimize search in pulled tags
- [ ] To optimize pulling (so bot pulls many jsons at once, parses them and if they all failed, pull another batch. not one by one like it's happening now)
- [ ] To make her post Reisen music from youtube once per day (I am sure there is *A LOT*)
- [ ] To upload Reisen emojis to our instance. And to make her use them in posts.
- [ ] **To write a presentative README.md file!!!**
